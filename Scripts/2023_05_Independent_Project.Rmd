# Let's Start With 
# Backround Information

# My Research
I am attempting to understand how both aerial and sea surface temperature are affecting the metabolism of respiration on the keystone species the owl limpet, *Lottia gigantea* and how that could affect different functions of this species like herbivory (grazing), growth, and territorial behavior. Learning about these effects could provide insight to possible changes to biodiversity the rocky intertidal could face in a variable climate.

--

I plan to execute my planned research by studying the effects of a variable climate by looking at changes in grazing, and growth rates of the owl limpets per season in two different locations of their geographical range, one "warm" site and one "cold" site. The reason for this is to figure out if there is any differences in the two populations in accordance to differences to their abiotic conditions like temperature experienced in the ocean and in the air.

--

You can find more information about this limpet on the NPS' [arcGIS](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/5d06971d96414e35b49d9327cc3bb956) website.

# Where to start

What is the temperature difference between seasons per site?

--

Is there a temperature difference between sites?

--

How do I do that?

# NOAA

--

NOAA is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA is a scientific and regulatory agency within the United States Department of Commerce. This agency collects data in order to produce products like weather forecasting, climate monitoring, fisheries management, coastal restoration, etc. 

--

The data that is collected is available online for scientist to use.

--

But how do you get it from the internet? 

--

Extract it using R!

# Extracting Data from NOAA

NOAA has a server data called [ERDDAP](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html). This data server provides the user with a simple, consistent way to download subsets of scientific datasets in common file formats. It also make graphs and maps.

--

There are a total of 3,099 datasets in this server data. We will be using dataset id [ncdcOisst21Agg_LonPM180](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/search/index.html?page=1&itemsPerPage=1000&searchFor=ncdcOisst21Agg_LonPM180).

--

You need specific longitude and latitude coordinates to narrow down your search area. We will be using:
1. latitude 34.1,34.1
1. longitude -119.875,-119.875
1. As of 05/08/2023, NOAA made changes to the ERDDAP website, we will be using [this link](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/ncdcOisst21Agg_LonPM180.graph) to find what we are looking for.

Two are needed to provide a graph with specific parameters.

# Starting Script
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE,

# Set up rerddap
```{r, rerddap}
####This tells R to use NOAA designated website and what data set to use#####
rerddap::info(datasetid = "ncdcOisst21Agg_LonPM180", url = "https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/")
```

## Next Steps and Data Dictionary
We set up our code to download selected data and create a data frame of columns that we can use. Because this data spans from 1981 to present, we will also be setting parameters to select a certain time frame. Downloading the entire data set will crash R. TRUST me, I have tried.

### Data Dictionary
```{r, echo=FALSE}
read_csv(here("Data", "data_dictionary.csv")) %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 12)
```


---
## Data Wrangling
```{r}
sci_temp_data<-griddap(datasetx = "ncdcOisst21Agg_LonPM180", # griddap is used to pull gridded data from ERDDAP. The data set we are using is named ncdcOisst21Agg_LonPM180
                   url = "https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/", # url we used earlier, the ERDDAP website
                   time = c("2020-01-01", "2022-12-31"), # The date range that we are looking for. In this case the last three years. More years will take longer to load.
                   zlev = c(0,0), # this is the elevation of the sea surface. It is always 0,0
                   latitude =  c(34.1,34.1), # latitude for SCI
                   longitude = c(-119.875,-119.875), # longitude for SCI 
                   fields = "sst")$data %>% # the specific field we are looking for is "sst"
  mutate(time = as.Date(stringr::str_remove(time, "T00:00:00Z"))) %>% # remove the "T00:00:00Z" using a stringer
  select(longitude, latitude, time, sst) %>% # select longitude, latitude, time and sst
  na.omit()%>% # remove any NA's
  mutate(month = month(time), # extract the month
         year = year(time), #extract the year
         site = "Santa Cruz Island", # create a new column with the site name
         season  = case_when( # create the seasons
           month %in% c(12,1,2) ~ "winter",
           month %in% c(3,4,5) ~ "spring",
           month %in% c(6,7,8) ~ "summer",
           month %in% c(9,10,11) ~ "fall"
         ),
         season = factor(season), # make season a factor
         season = fct_relevel(season, c("winter","spring","summer","fall"))) # use factor relevel to make the seasons go in order
```


---

## Summarize Data

Let's summarize the data to provide averages per year by season by grouping the data. We can then make a table using the kable function
```{r}
sci_temp_data %>%
  group_by(year,season)%>% # group by year and season
  summarise(temp.mean = mean(sst, na.rm = TRUE), # average of sst
            temp.max = max(sst, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% # max sst
  kbl()%>% #make a table
  kable_styling(full_width = F, font_size = 9) #use this to change the font
```

# Plots

.pull-left[
```{r, sci-plot1, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(sci_temp_data, # data used is the sci_temp_data we created
       aes(x = time, #x axis is time
           y = sst))+ #y axis is sea surface temperature
  labs(title = "Santa Cruz Island", #title
       x = "Year", # label for x axis
       y = "Sea Surface Temperature, (C)", # label for y axis
       color = "Season")+ # legend label
  theme_bw()+
  geom_line()+ # draw a line graph
  geom_point(aes(color = season))+ # add points colored by seasons
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue",
                                "green",
                                "red",
                                "orange")) # set colors I want to use
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r sci-plot1-out, ref.label="sci-plot1", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

---
# Plots Con't

.pull-left[
```{r, sci-plot2, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sci_temp_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(year), # make year a factor for the x axis
             y = sst, # y axis
             fill = season))+ # fill by season
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title = "Santa Cruz Island", # plot title
       fill = "Season", # legend label
       x = "Year", # x axis label
       y = "Sea Surface Temperature (C)")+ # y axis label
  theme_bw()+
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue",
                                "green",
                                "red",
                                "orange")) # set colors I want to use
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r sci-plot2-out, ref.label="sci-plot2", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

# Functions
Since the code is the same for the line graph and the box plot, I decided to create functions. This will come in handy when I have more than 3 sites.

```{r, line-plot-fxn, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sci_line_plot <- function(data){ggplot(data, # data used is the sci_temp_data we created
       aes(x = time, #x axis is time
           y = sst))+ #y axis is sea surface temperature
  labs(color = "Season")+ # legend label
  theme_bw()+
  geom_line()+ # draw a line graph
  geom_point(aes(color = season))+ # add points colored by seasons
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue",
                                "green",
                                "red",
                                "orange")) # set colors I want to use
  
}

```

#### Lets Try it using the same data and labels

.pull-left[
```{r function1, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sci_line_plot(sci_temp_data)+
  labs(title = "Santa Cruz Island", #title
       x = "Year", # label for x axis
       y = "Sea Surface Temperature, (C)") # label for y axis
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r sci-plot1-out, ref.label="sci-plot1", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```
]

---

# Another Function

```{r box-plot-fxn, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sci_box_plot <- function(data){ggplot(data, 
          aes(x = as.factor(year), # make year a factor for the x axis
          y = sst, # y axis
          fill = season))+ # fill by season
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(fill = "Season")+ # legend label
  theme_bw()+
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue",
                                "green",
                                "red",
                                "orange")) # set colors I want to use
  }
```

---

#### Lets Try it using the same data and labels

.pull-left[
```{r function2-out, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sci_box_plot(sci_temp_data)+
  labs(title = "Santa Cruz Island", #title
       x = "Year", # label for x axis
       y = "Sea Surface Temperature, (C)") # label for y axis
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r sci-plot2-out, ref.label="sci-plot2", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```
