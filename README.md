This repository will teach the user how to download **Interpolated Ocean Sea Surface Temperature** from NOAA. There is information on data manipulation to create tables and graphs to visualize the data. Expect to see:
1. Pictures of owl limpets
2. Sea Surface Temperarures from Santa Cruz Island, Channel Islands, CA, USA
3. Tables with above mentioned data
4. A line plot 
5. A bar plot
6. Functions to help with plotting

The code in this repository is code that I am actively using in my research.
